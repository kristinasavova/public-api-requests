# public-api-requests
 An app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. The app allows emplyees to share contact information with each other. 

The Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) is used to grab information for 12 random “employees”.

In styles.css, I experimented with text-shadows, colors and background colors.
